* Detailed Movie Information: View comprehensive details for each movie, including posters, overviews, and other relevant data.

* Responsive UI Design: Ensures an optimal viewing and interaction experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

* Modular Component Architecture: Built with reusable React components for maintainability and scalability.

* Data Persistence (via Appwrite): (Potentially) Allows for user-specific data storage, such as favorite movies or watchlists, if implemented.

* Loading Indicators: Provides a smooth user experience with spinner components during data fetching.

## Tech Stack
This project leverages a modern web development stack to deliver a robust and scalable application.

### Frontend:

* HTML5: The backbone for structuring web content.

* CSS3: For styling and visual presentation, ensuring a modern and appealing user interface.

* JavaScript (ES6+): For interactive functionality and dynamic content manipulation.

* React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, emphasizing component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.

* Vite: A fast build tool for modern web projects, used for development and bundling.

* ESLint: Configured for code quality and consistency.

### Backend/Services:

Appwrite: An open-source, self-hosted backend-as-a-service platform providing various services like databases and authentication. It handles data persistence and other backend logic for the application.

### APIs Used
* The Movie Database (TMDB) API: Used to fetch movie information, including search results, popular movies, and detailed movie data.

* Appwrite API: Utilized for backend services, such as managing user data, potentially storing favorite movies or watchlists, and handling authentication.

cd [YourRepositoryName]

* Install dependencies:
This project is a React application built with Vite.

npm install

* Environment Variables Setup:
Create a .env.local file in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables. You will need to obtain these keys from the respective services.

VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY_HERE
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID_HERE
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=YOUR_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID_HERE
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=YOUR_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID_HERE

VITE_TMDB_API_KEY: Obtain this from The Movie Database API.

VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID, VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID, VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID: Obtain these from your Appwrite Console after setting up your project, database, and collection.

## Usage
Once installed and configured, you can start the development server:

npm run dev

* Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified by Vite, usually shown in your terminal after running npm run dev).
